# :arrows_counterclockwise: Google API Data Pipeline Project

## Introduction

### Objective
The aim of this project was to automate the monthly collection, transformation, and presentation of web analytics data from Google Analytics 4 and Google Search Console into a Google Sheet. This automation streamlines the process of monitoring and reporting key performance metrics, facilitating easier analysis and access to data.

### Tools and technologies used
- **Python**: For scripting the data collection and transformation processes.
- **Google Analytics Data API and Google Search Console API**: For accessing and retrieving web analytics data.
- **Google Sheets API**: For loading and visualizing data in a user-friendly format.
- **OAuth2.0**: For secure API authentication.
- **Jupyter Notebook and Visual Code Studio**: For developing, testing, and documenting the code.

### Project outcomes
- Enabled automated, timely, and error-free reporting of key web metrics, significantly reducing manual effort and enhancing the decision-making process.
- Developed reusable code modules for fetching and processing API data, which can be adapted for other similar projects or expanded to include additional data sources.

### Skills demonstrated
- Utilizing cloud-based APIs for data integration
- Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation
- Automating and scheduling Python scripts
